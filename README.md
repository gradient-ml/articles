# Gradient articles

A good amount of writing for the Gradient currently happens on Google Docs, Overleaf, PDFs, and Quip.

This repository is part of a larger effort to systematize and streamline the article editing process. If you'd like
to be added to the organization, send a message on Slack in #editing or #writing.

If your article is in Markdown or LaTeX, we encourage you to put the drafts here so that edits can be tracked!
